Portfolio website description: This website was a reflection of things that I valued as an entrepreneur learning how to develop. I wanted it to reflect bits off my personality and also showcase some of my professional experience. I used wireframes to design the look and layout and I followed the following thesis. I wanted a navigation bar at the top of the website to ensure that, anyone viewing had ample opportunities to move around freely on the website making it easy to discover the pages. On my index page, i wanted to feature shortened versions of the website. Following the navigation bar, I created a hero section, that included a photo off myself, and links to both my linkedin and my github to allow for seamless connections. Following this, I had my work experience and history, for the last three things I achieved to demonstrate work I had completed. Following this I had a small segment to demonstrate somethings about me, with generalised text. Following this I wanted easy access to my blog so i placed in a summarised blog section that allows people to go straight to blogs about things that I care about. Under this i had a section where people are able to contact me in the footer, this was done to also have seamless connections to anyone visiting my site. As the intended audience for my page would ideally be technology recruiters for either start-ups or scale-ups looking to hire for software engineering or product manager roles. 

The work experience page was quite simple, I wanted to have a few boxes to include my work and study history in a row formation to ensure it was easy to read. The about me section was also just a few boxes of text, with a picture of me. and the blog pages, where pages, with a title, published and then also a picture to give the blog a bit more meaning. 

The tech stack i implemented for this role includes, HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Graphical html and css to allow for highlighting and transitions of boxes that people could click on.
